# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a program that executes some sort of action.

  Researched answer: "In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value."



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map takes a copy of an array and returns a new array with different values. .filter takes an array and filters out specific values and returns a new array with only the specified values.

  Researched answer: "They both return a new array. map returns a new array of elements where you have applied some function on the element so that it changes the original element (typically). filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array (with no change to the original values). filter will only return elements where the function you specify returns a value of true for each element passed to the function."



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: return is what you want the program to execute after a condition. console.log() is what allows you to actually execute that code.

  Researched answer: "The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have used a variable value. The console.log(); is a function that will write the argument value on the console."


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: The argument is the value of a function

  Researched answer: In mathematics, an argument of a function is a value that must be provided to obtain the function's result.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Be polite, one should be the "navigator" and the other should be the "driver", switch off every 20 minutes. Allow each other to try to solve the code even if you know it won't work, be respectful, be patient and understanding of everyones skill level, COMMUNICATE, don't be an a-hole.

  Researched answer: Permission to make mistakes, encouragement to experiment, constructive feedback, friendly disposition, active engagement.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: Not sure..

  Researched answer: Test driven development! duh.. "Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. "



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Having the instructors walking around to check up on us while we do the coding challenges and helping us when we needed them. You're all super awesome and helpful. I can tell that you want us to succeed. Thank you.
